            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

next following, which was the 21ſt day of the ſame Moneth, 1680. which we
could not well omit, as with clearneſs in the ſight of God, or with inward
Satisfaction to our Conſciences, although we underſtood beforehand what
Evil Agents, Perſecuting Informers and Diſturbers were apt to be buſie
againſt our Friends Meeting in that City; we freely ſubmitted to the Will
of God, and with our Eye to him reſigned to divine Providence, as to what
might be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to come to paſs for the holy Truth's ſake and

                  <p>Upon the 21ſt day of the 1ſt Moneth, 1680. being the firſt
day of the Week, the Meeting of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> of the

Afternoon, for about half of the uſual Time of the Meeting, in which time,
<hi>Thomas Burr</hi> had an opportunity peaceably to declare the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99892:5"/>Truth, and after him <hi>George Whitehead</hi> for a little
ſpace; in the enterim came in a rude Company, chiefly Informers,
Tumultuouſly and Violently crowding into the Meeting, to pull G.W. down: He
divers times required them to ſhew ſome Legal Authority: They uſed
ſeveral abuſive words, and endeavoured to inſinuate to the People,
<hi>That he might be a Jeſuit;</hi> and demanded our Names and Places of
Abode. G.W. detected their Abuſe and falſe defaming Inſinuation to the
People, and diſcovered his Name and Habitation, to prevent Suſpition in the
People. Again, he demanded by what Authority they came thus to diſturb our
Meeting, and call us in Queſtion? bidding them produce their Warrant; but
they refuſed to give Account, or ſhew any Warrant. So after ſome
Tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Buſtie, and Hiddious Noiſe that they made in the Meeting (being
prevented by the great Crowd, from coming at us to hale us away) the chief of
them with-drew; and in a little time after, one of the Sheriff,<note n="†" place="margin">i.e. <hi>Tho. Seamans.</hi>

in, calling for us, and came to us (the People making way for him) he required
us to go along with him, taking G.W. faſt hold by the hand, and led him along
out of the Meeting, near about half way to the Priſon, with other Perſons
with him, that were the Diſturbers and Informers, to guard us along to the
Priſon; the Sheriff turned us in at the Goal Door, and left us there, where
we were detained about two Hours, and then were ſent for, and by the Goaler

of the Pariſh was alſo with him, who at firſt ſeemed offended, and
began to Queſtion with us about our Hats, and afterward about
<hi>Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c. often interrupting and interpoſing between us
and the Juſtice, as one ſeeking occaſion againſt us, but was plainly
anſwered and reprehended by us, the Priſoners, for his Incivility, though
the Recorder ſhewed no diſlike of his Carriage; who having his Law-Books
and Bible before him, firſt begun with us about our Names, Habitations and
Trades; and enquired, <hi>If we were in Orders, or had Orders from</hi> Rome.
To all which we gave him a plain Account, denying any ſuch Orders; and
ſolemnly (in the Preſence of God) declared our Abhorrance of
<hi>Popery.</hi> Then he Queſtioned us about our Preaching that day in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99892:5"/>Meeting. To which we alſo gave him a Plain and Chriſtian
Anſwer. After ſome Diſcourſe, he read part of the <hi>Act againſt
Conventicles,</hi> 22 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. and inſiſted upon
it, That we were Offenders of it; and threatned, that he would Fine us 20
<abbr>l.</abbr> a man; and then demanded of us to Depoſit the Money: But we
told him, we had not Freedom to do that, although we have Eſtate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Reſponſible (that lie open to the
Law) where our Habitations are: This we told him, and did ſome-what
inſiſt upon it, that he might not F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne others on our account: And partly to prevent him from impoſing
the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> upon us, to circumvent and entrap us,
he being about it, queſtioned us, <hi>Whether we would take it or not?</hi>
We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in General, That we could take no Oath for Conſcience ſake;
and therefore deſired him to take that as a Caution, not to go about to
enſnare us there-with, ſince he had begun with us upon another Statute,
touching our Meeting. He ſaid, <hi>If we would neither pay the Fines, nor
take the Oath, he would commit us to Goal:</hi> And finding none ready to
depoſit the Fines, the Informer whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the Ear (as he ſuffered
him ſeveral times to do, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted by the Priſoners to the
contrary,) Then he enquired, <hi>When we came into the City? and where we
lodged? and where we ſet up our Horſes?</hi> To all which we gave him
account; whereupon one or more of the Informers (after ſome whiſpering with
the Recorder) went from him to the Inn where our Horſes ſtood, but in the
very enterim ſome Friends took them away unknown to us the Priſoners,
(though ſome have wrongfully upbraided us in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as craftily
deſigning and knowing of it.) So he told us, <hi>He would commit us to
Priſon, till next Seſſions, and there the Oath of Allegiance ſhould be
again tendred us; and we ſhould be Praemunired if we refuſed to take it:
But if we would pay our Fines, he ſhould not ſend us to Priſon:</hi>
Which we not doing (having told him where our Habitations and Eſtates were,
which were Reſponſible) he concluded with theſe Words, viz. <hi>De non
aparentibus et non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtentibus eadem eſt ratio;</hi> Of things not
appearing, and things not in beeing, there is the ſame Reaſon,
<hi>i.e.</hi> Our Eſtates that are at <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Ware</hi>
appear not at <hi>Norwich;</hi> therefore they are not <hi>in Rerum
Natura,</hi> or not in beeing.—Strange kind of Logick, or Reaſon in
this Caſe! After a little ſpace he told us, <hi>That if we would give in
Security to appear at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Quarter-Seſſions, he would not ſend
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> to <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99892:6"/>Goal:</hi>
Which we not having Freedom to give, we requeſted of him, That he would but
let us lodge out of Priſon that Night, that convenient Lodging might be made
ready in Priſon for us (it being then ſome-what late in the Evening) we
promiſing (God willing) to appear at Priſon next Morning; and ſome others
preſent, proffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Engage for our forth-coming then: No, by no means
would he grant us that ſmall Civility, unleſs we would Engage in 40
<abbr>l.</abbr> Bond or Security for our appearance next Morning at Priſon;
which Kindneſs of his, not being worth farther Diſcourſe, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
not of it. So he ſent us that Night to the Goal, where we remain ſatisfied
in the Will of the Lord, to wait upon him in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Submiſſion to
his good Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Many material things paſſed between us, which cannot well be

                  <p>I do not charge the Court, I do diſtinguiſh between the

which in courſe is laſt, according to his own Mittimus and Warrant [And is
not that Prepoſterous?] Let our Mittimus be read, and that will ſhew we

                  <speaker>G.W.</speaker>
                  <p>We ought to have due proceſs or proceeding in due courſe
of Law; therefore the Court ſhould know, how we were firſt Arreſted, and
turned into Goal by the Sheriff, without Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Mittimus or Warrant; and
how afterward had out and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and what the Mittimus is; What are the
Premiſſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, that we are to anſwer unto.</p>
                  <p>The Law of <hi>England</hi> is tender of mens Liberties,
Properties, Eſtates and Lives, all which are concerned in our Impriſonment;
<hi>Lex Anglia'</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>Lex Miſericordiae, i.e.</hi> the Law
of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is a Law of Mercy; one Reaſon whereof is, that the

                     <hi>Look what an Argument or Conſequence you would draw from

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99892:12"/>
                     <hi>therefore Thieves or Malefactors, &amp;c. muſt not be

                  <speaker>G.W.</speaker>
                  <p>That's none of my Conſequence; mine is the ſame that Judge

Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſericordiae,</hi> in that 'tis tender of mens Liberties, and preſcribes
a due courſe of Proceedure—Interrupted—as it may be applyed to
our Caſe. Either we are Innocent or Nocent; if Innocent, we ought to be
heard, and not delayed in Priſon; if Nocent or Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, we ought to have
due and orderly proceeding, according to the Law of the Land, that our Offence
may the more plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that others may take warning thereby, and not
incur the like Penalty or Suffering. However, let's have fair dealing; let's
not be unduely run upon, diverted from our Plea, and our Mouthes ſtopt, ſo
that the Court and People here cannot know what we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for.—</p>
                  <p>No Free-man ſhall be taken or impriſoned, or diſſeized
of his Freehold, or otherwiſe deſtroyed, &amp;c. but by due proceſs and
order of Law.—</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Magna Charta</hi> enjoyns, where in the 29th Chapter
'tis ſaid, <hi>No Free-man ſhall be taken or impriſoned,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>but by the Law of the Land;</hi> that is, by due order of Law, by due
proceſs, according to Law. The Law of <hi>England</hi> requires due proceſs
or proceeding, from the very firſt Arreſt, taking and impriſoning to the
very end and execution of the ſame. Therefore the firſt Arreſt,
Impriſoning and Committing us, ought to be known and underſtood, whether it
was in due Manner and courſe of Law, Yea or Nay.</p>
                  <p>Let us have our Mittimus read, we expect it; 'tis granted and
promiſed us by the Mayor and others indifferent. A little reſpit in

The Warrant or Mittimus (faith he) containing a Lawful Cauſe, ought to have a

breach of the Peace. For it cannot be Juſtice to excuſe or acquit
Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Fellons, or Breakers and Violaters of the Peace, by tendring them
the Oath of Allegiance, or by their taking it. (That were an eaſie way for
Traytors and Fellons, &amp;c. to eſcape the condign pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the Law)
There's other proceſs or proceeding in Law, more properly limitted and
aſſigned againſt them. For how many Oaths would not Traytors and Fellons
take! if Swearing would free them from the Judgment or condign puniſhment of
the Law? What Oaths would not ſuch take to ſave themſelves?</p>

ſeem'd not to deny the tender of the Oath to be a proceſs in Law: His
Anſwer, i.e. <hi>That your Meetings are againſt the publick Peace,</hi> was
beſides the point. His requiring the Oath is neither the Proceſs nor the

                  <p>
                     <hi>You ſhall have the Oath put to you. And I'le tell you what
dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger you incur: If you refuſe to take it, you are to be put out of the
King's protection, your Lands and Eſtates forfeit to the King, and your
Bodies Impriſoned during the King's pleaſure,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>We underſtand what a Praemunire means, according to the Statute of
Praemunire, made in the ſixteenth Year of King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the
ſecond: Though there's no Equity, that ſhould be brought upon us, whilſt
we Practice our Allegiance. Suppoſe we cannot for Conſcience ſake Swear:
'Tis but hard meaſure to bring us under the penalty of Praemunire, for that
cauſe only. What Equity can there be in it? Seeing we utterly deny the
<hi>Pope</hi> and<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99892:19"/>
                     <hi>Popery,</hi> &amp;c. (To which we may
juſtly add) and abhor thoſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Practices and Poſitions, which
are abjured by that Oath.</p>

                  <speaker>G.W.</speaker>
                  <p>Suppoſe we have ſuch a ſcruple of Conſcience, as that we
cannot Swear Allegiance, whilſt we both practice it, and are willing to
declare it; and to ſign the Declaration (or ſubſtance) of our Allegiance.
Can it be equal or juſt to run us to a Praemunire, to forfeit our Eſtates,
Liberties, &amp;c. only for want of Swearing? How can that be either
<hi>ſecundum qualitatem,</hi> or <hi>ſecundum qualitatem delicti</hi> (as

                  <speaker>G.W.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis that Knowledge that God hath placed in man: 'tis a knowing
together between God and our own Souls, by Virtue of the Law of God in man,
whereby he knows what's Good, and what's Evil; and whereby he is taught to
embrace the Good, and ſhun the Evil. 'Tis called, The Law of Truth, the Law
of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Law of Reaſon, &amp;c. Againſt which Law (ſays the
Law-Book, <hi>Doctor</hi> and <hi>Student</hi>) no Law nor Cuſtom ought to be

                  <p>'Tis true; ſome mens Conſciences become hardned and ſeared,

were not duely nor regularly brought upon that point, as to give a poſitive

in Court. We requeſt further time to be heard upon an Adjournment (before we

proceeding againſt them; but that they had more, both of Moderation and
Juſtice in them; and that he carried things on, too much over their Heads,
and all to run down and enſnare the Priſoners, to Oppreſs them, and
continue them under Suffering.</p>

            <p>ON the aforeſaid 17th day of the 3d Moneth, 1680. our Friends,
<hi>Mary Duncon</hi> and <hi>Mary de France</hi> of <hi>Norwich</hi> attended
the Court of Mayor and Juſtices in their Council-Chamber, and delivered the
aforeſaid Application and Certificates to them, where they were read, as the
Priſoners were informed.</p>
            <p>After the Mayor and Juſtices came down into the Hall, our Friends
aboveſaid attended the Court of Seſſions, and moved for the Liberty of
the Priſoners (as ſome of the Juſtices had before directed) To which,
others of them ſaid, <hi>That could not be, for they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Order
of Seſſions;</hi> which the Steward (being then Judge of the Court, in the
Recorders abſence) cauſed to be read. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Duncon</hi> then
requeſted, the Priſoners might be called into Court, and heard, the new
Recorder having promiſed her (as ſhe affirmed immediately after ſhe came
from him) <hi>That they ſhould be called into Court; and that if it appeared
they were committed contrary<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99892:25"/>to Law, they ſhould be
Diſcharged.</hi> But he being then abſent, they were not called into
Court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Samuel Boulton</hi> of <hi>London</hi> being preſent, got leave
of the Court (upon his requeſt) to tell them, <hi>That he did ſuppoſe it
was contrary to Law, to make the Firſt Tender of the Oath in Court; and that
'twas done on purpoſe to Enſnare the Priſoners.</hi> Whereupon the
Steward called to bring the <hi>Statute-Book,</hi> to ſee whether it was ſo
or not; but in the interim (after a little Conſultation) the Court was
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt on a ſuddain, before the Book came. So the Priſoners were
detained until the next Quarter-Seſſions. Whereof an Account is hereafter
given, as to their Diſcharge.</p>

                  <p>THe great pretence for this our ſtrict detention in your Goal,

injured, in that we were not ſuffered to be called into Court the laſt Day
of your Quarter-Seſſions, for an opportunity to have made our Exception,
which we conceive we had good ground for both in Law and good Conſcience;
eſpecially, ſince we had Promiſe of ſuch an opportunity, and that if it
appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Commitment were contrary to Law, we ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged:
This we underſtand was made to one of our Friends, who (upon encouragement by
ſome of the Juſtices) moved for our Liberty in Court; which not being
granted then, that we might be called into Court; but being prevented of both,
we are detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our, and our Families, great prejudice in divers
reſpects; our preſent reſtraint being alſo a depriving us of our Rights
in the Creation, and to the impairing of our Healths. The late Order from

of the laſt, when the Illegality thereof had been made appear (which we
endeavoured an opportunity for) as well as an Error in proceſs may the ſame

upon a falſe pretence of our Poverty, after we had plainly ſignified the

Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, ſo as he could have no reaſon to judge or think us

                  <p>But beſides the Illegality hereof, pray what Juſtice or
Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance could there be between his Fining others becauſe of our
Poverty, and committing us to Goal becauſe of our Non-payment thereof? He
impriſons us becauſe we do not pay our Fines; and layes our Fines upon
others becauſe we cannot pay them.</p>
                  <p>But this is not the leaſt inconſiſtance in his perplexed

common Goal, upon pretence of being aſſembled in diſturbance of the
publick Peace (by a Warrant made in his own, and not in the King's Name) and
then layes our Fines upon others, which was all for one and the ſame Meeting.
And theſe proceeding are as reconciable, as if he had Fined us for Praying,
and committed us to Goal for Fighting whilſt at Prayer; But we are more
Serious in our Devotion, and Innocent in our Deportment, bleſſed be the

                     <item>

and circumvent us, before the Proceſs or Charge of our Commitment were
determined in Court, notwithſtanding our Mittimus ſignified, that we were
then to anſwer to the Premiſſes therein contained, and alſo begged,
that for God's ſake and the King's ſake (as you may remember, with our

                     <item>

War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and his firſt pretended tender of the Oath (by himſelf alone)
were reverſt by our being diſcharged in Court from the matters contained in
them, he would not ſuffer us to be actually freed of our Impriſonment; but
in perſuance of his premeditated Deſign forced a tender of the Oath, <hi>de

Commitment to Goal without Bail or Mainprize, untill the next
Quarter-Seſſions, without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing us any further time for Conſideration

                     <item> 
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> His precipitancy and raſhneſs towards
us, was ſuch therein, that the reſt of the Juſtices, doubtleſs, could
not take ſo much time and deliberation, as to conſider of theſe his
Proceedings, before he concluded the ſaid order of Commitment, wherein they
might very well, and but juſtly, have given him a Check, &amp; put a ſtop
to his ſwift and furious Motion, for a more general and ſerious
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Caſe among them, and not have ſuffered him to

Warning alſo in our publickly deſiring to know, If you were all of a mind,
or agreed againſt us, as to that ſevere Commitment, charitably hoping (as
we do ſtill) that you were not; but no Anſwer could we have in that Caſe:
The Recorder was in ſuch haſte for that Concluſion againſt us, and the
Courts Adjournment, and to have the Goaler to take away the Priſoners; He
would have you to underſtand, he wanted his Dinner, upbraiding us (the
Priſoners) with an idle Story of our being at a Feaſt the Night

                     <item> 
                        <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Beſides, his <hi>de novo,</hi> tender of
the Oath to us, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, in Seſſions appeared neither Legal nor
Formal, according to the form of Statute 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> Cap. 4. which intends
<hi>Popiſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants (as appears plainly by the Title and Preamble

Cap. 6. for a firſt tender of the Oath, to be made out of Court or
Quarter-Seſſions, and a Commitment of the party refuſing, and the
ſecond tender in the open Aſſize or Quarter-Seſſions, in ſuch
manner and on ſuch precedent Cauſes as the Law directs, and wherein we were
unconcerned.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And moreover, neither of theſe Statutes of King <hi>James</hi> do

Quarter-Seſſions to another, without Bail or Mainprize, as is the late
order of our Commitment. Pray ſee what <hi>Council</hi> ſaith in relation

                  <p> 1<hi>ſt,</hi>
                     <q>I conceive the third Warrant is not good in the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For
as 'tis true, that Act ſays, The Offenders ſhall incur a Praemunire; yet it
doth not in the leaſt give them any Power to commit the Perſon, and
therefore, &amp; for that its without Bailor Mainprize, and to a certain time,
and not leaving it to the Law. I conceive its againſt Law, and will be
remedied, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p> 2<hi>dly,</hi> He further ſaith,
<q>By the Statute of 3 <hi>Jac</hi> 4. The party that is to take the
Oath, is to be one that is Convicted or Indicted for Recuſancy, or not taking
the Sacrament twice in the Year <pb n="52" facs="tcp:99892:30"/>paſt; and the Parties to
tender it, are either the Biſhop or two Juſtices of the Peace, whereof one
of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> and upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, they may commit without Bail or
Mainprize, untill next Aſſize or Seſſions, where it may be again
tendered. By the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute 7 <hi>Jac.</hi> 6. any one Juſtice may tender the
Oath to one that is preſented, Indicted or Convicted for not coming to
Church, or receiving the Sacrament, according to Law; or if the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
Petty-Conſtable and Church-Wardens, or any two of them, ſhall complain to

                        </gap>, and the Juſtice ſhall find Cauſe of Suſpition,
then he may tender and proceed as above. But all this I conceive with
clearneſs, to be meant and intended <hi>Popiſh</hi> Recuſants. But
admitting it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I conceive as this Fact is now put, the Proceedings
are not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable by the above-ſaid Laws, nor any other; for here is no
ſuch Preſentment, Conviction or Indictment, as the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ore I conceive the Parties grieved may be relieved, &amp;c.</q>

Beſt, your Cleareſt and Wiſeſt way to have manifeſted your
Diſſent (as we gave caution at firſt) from <hi>Francis Bacons's</hi>
precipitant irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar dealing with us about the Oath, and his illegal
Commitment from Seſſions, which is entred for protect of Authority, with
the Title <hi>pro Curiam;</hi> and therefore our ſtrict Confinement thereby
as your Act, howbeit 'tis not ſubſcribed by any of you: Wherefore we yet in
Love and Good Will to you, both for your own inward Peace, and outward
Reputations, as well as our own Rights, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt our Liberty, we being
wronged, hurt and grieved in divers reſpects by the ſaid Proceedings of
your late Recorder; whereof we do once more make our Complaint to you for
Relief, according as we think our ſelves obliged in Conſcience, and
directed alſo by Law; Pray view the Statute of the 4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. c. 12.
for 'tis a good one, 'tis worth your reading: Judge <hi>Cook</hi> cites
it,<note place="margin">See his <hi>Inſtit.</hi> 4 part. fol. 170.</note> and
inſiſts upon it as a neceſſary Caveat to all Juſtices of Peace:
<q>For that by the ſaid Statute Proviſion is made for any Subject
that is hurt or grieved in any thing, that remedy may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99892:30"/>or deferred, being directed to make complaint to the
Juſtice or Juſtices, and to deſire Remedy; and if he have no Remedy, to
ſhew his Complaint to the Juſtices of Aſſize, if it be nigh the time of
their coming, but if it be too long afore their coming, then the grieved to
come to the King's Highneſs, or his Chancellor, and ſhew his Grief:
Whereupon the King ſhall ſend for the ſaid Juſtice, to know the
Cauſe, why his ſaid Subjects be not eaſed? And if he find any of them in
default in theſe Premiſſes, he ſhall do to him ſo offending to be put
out of Commiſſion, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now as we can in good Conſcience ſay, we are Perſons that
refuſe not to Swear in favour to any Principles of Diſloyalty or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
Thus much in relation to the Declaration of Allegiance contained in the Oath of

abhorrence of all thoſe Horrid, Seditious and Treaſonable Practices,
Principles and Poſitions, which are abjured and renounced in the ſaid
Oath.</q>
                  <p>This Declaration (in the ſight of him who ſearches all Hearts)
we do really aſſent to and own, and (through his gracious

ſhewn Civility to us in any kind, as we acknowledge you have, in admitting us
ſome diſcourſe with you. One reaſon of our ſaid Requeſt was,
becauſe the other Juſtices lately gave conſent to our enlargement: If the
Recorder would conſent or adviſe thereto (as the Meſſenger told us.) We
ſtill really apprehending our ſelves unduly proceeded with, and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
detained, by the late Recorder's means, both in regard of our own Innocency,
and of the Injury and Hurt we have divers wayes ſuſtained by this our
Confinement for near four Moneths paſt, to the impairing our Healths,
afflicting our Families, and detriment to our Concerns; And not being wholly
ignorant in point of Law, how unwarrantable the procedure is againſt us from
firſt to laſt, being alſo confirmed in our weak Apprehenſions therein
by Perſons learned in the Laws; as <hi>Council</hi> hath lately given it
under Hand, <hi>That indeed, its an irregular proceeding throughout.</hi> And
that the late Commitment by which we are detained is not good, but againſt
Law: And therefore its being given or pleaded as an Order of, Seſſions, or
as <hi>pro Curiam</hi> cannot rationally argue it to be an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible
Law; you know better in Law and Logick doubtleſs. Theſe things

We were no Offenders, till a Trap was laid to make us ſuch. by <hi>Francis
Bacon,</hi> in his Abruptly ſurprizing us with that Oath, to run us to a
Praemunire (a he had threatned us afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand) whereas the Law was never

peaceable Converſation,</hi> but alſo declares it in the ſight of God and
Men, and is willing to ſign and ſubſcribe ſuch Declaration of his Duty
of Allegiance, if he may not otherwiſe be believed, only he
conſcientiouſly ſcruples to ſay, <hi>I Swear, and to kiſs the
Book,</hi> to make his Declaration an Oath; for want only of which
circumſtance and ceremony this poor inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent man and ſincere Proteſtant
muſt be run to a Praemunire, his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty loſt, and the little Eſtate or
Subſtance he has muſt be forfeited, and all taken from him; his poor Wife
and ſmall Children left deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, wholly Impoveriſhed and want Bread;
his Wife muſt go Mourning and wringing her Hands, and ſhedding of Tears
night and day, for the hard meaſure ſhe has met withal, and her Children
dolefully Crying and Mourning for want of Bread! Where's now either
Conſcience, Equity, Reaſon, Juſtice or Mercy? Were it not very Inhumane
thus to deſtroy innocent and harmeleſs <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> (and thereby
to gratifie the Popiſh Spirit and Party) meerly becauſe ſuch
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> are afraid of an Oath? They dare not Swear. And how is
the real intent and end of the Law anſwered by ſuch ſevere and inhumane
dealing with innocent <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who never were impeached nor
juſt'y chargeable either with treaſonable Attempts, Principles or
Practices? They cannot be detected either with actual Treaſon, or being
infected with any Treaſonable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples by any of their Teachers or others.
And therefore, no ſuch Perſons or People as thoſe Laws of Praemunire were
really intended againſt, though ſuch can eſcape them. We can appeal to
God, Angels, and all juſt impartial Men, this is our Caſe; We are not the
People, which in point of Equity or Juſtice, the Law could ever be intended
againſt; We are of no ſuch deſtructive Principles <pb n="83" facs="tcp:99892:45"/>or
Practices, as either the nature of the Oath points at and intends, or the
Statute of Praemunire, 16 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 5. was provided againſt,
unto which Statute, both that of the 3d of K. <hi>James c.</hi> 4. and 7th of

Perſons refuſing to Swear to the <hi>Dealaration</hi> of their Allegiance.
Let that of 16 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 5. be conſidered, as to the nature

ſcruple or fear to Swear to the Declaration of our Allegiance, whilſt we
ſincerely perform the Duty thereof, by our harmleſs and peaceable
Converſation among men, (as our Neighbours are Eye Witneſſes) both as

anſwers the Intent and End of the Law. Our diſſent (in point of
Conſcience and Worſhip) being out of no reſpect to <hi>Popery,</hi> but
the contrary: For we really believe, we are more clearly Reformed
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> than thoſe are from whom we diſſent: Where's then
the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or equality between our ſuppoſed Offence (which is but
Circumſtantial at moſt) and the Penalty? There's no <hi>parity</hi> at all
between them. Let the Law of Truth, Juſtice, Equity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in all

Partiality, which (without any due meaſure of things, and without all
Compaſſion) ſeeks occaſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us to deſtroy us, which the
Righteous God and juſt Judge of Heaven and Earth will plead with and judge.
Let due meaſures be taken of Offences and Penalties, which ought to be
ſuitable: Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties ought not to exceed the Offences (but to be

to be made Offences which really are none. Let Juſtice and Right take place,
and equal Law and execution of Right be followed, according to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Laws and Rights of <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, and that which all the Kings
Juſtices and Miniſters (who under him are appointed for<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99892:47"/>that end) are obliged unto both in the ſight of God and men, as
